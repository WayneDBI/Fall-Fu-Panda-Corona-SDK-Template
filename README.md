Fall Fu Panda is a complete template to build a game where by the WORLD revolves and your player falls into position. This template includes all the code to help you create rotating physics worlds dynamically, with the ability to zoom out and see the world, track the players position and full rotation. With your player falling onto objects to score points or destroy enemies. Why not build a game where your hero has to escape a dungeon or cave? This Corona Template includes everything to get you going. See the video below and see how easy it would be for you to create a full game based on this unique technique.

To help optimisation, we used Sprite sheets and to build the demo level we used Gumbo. We then used the co-ordinates for each of the world items that the Gumbo tool provides and used those in our Lua code. It’s super-easy to create more levels, especially with Gumbo.

To play, simply tap the LEFT or RIGHT hand side of the screen to rotate the world. Your player will then fall to the next block. If he falls outside it’s game over, and you have to start again.
